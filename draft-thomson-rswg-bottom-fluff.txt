       Making RFC and Internet-Draft Boilerplate Less Conspicuous
                 draft-thomson-rswg-bottom-fluff-latest

Abstract

   This document establishes a new policy for RFCs and Internet-Drafts
   that moves all the fluff (copyright notices and that sort of thing)
   to the bottom of documents.

   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's Legal
   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents (https://trustee.ietf.org/

   Please review these documents carefully, as they describe your rights
   and restrictions with respect to this document.


1.  New Policy

   No one reads the legal shrink wrap.  All we do by forcing it under
   their noses is annoy them and waste their time.

   The IETF can better serve its audience by moving boilerplate in RFCs
   and Internet-Drafts to the bottom of documents.  This ensures that
   notices exist, but are minimally annoying.

2.  Precedent

   In the beginning, there was no fluff (e.g., [RFC0768]).  When fluff
   first started, the "status of this memo" section mainly served as an
   abstract (e.g., [RFC0959]).  Later, its substantive contents were
   moved down to an "abstract" section (e.g., [RFC1601]).  Eventually,
   someone noticed that having the fluff before the abstract was
   unhelpful, so the abstract was placed first (e.g., [RFC5545]).  We
   are now following a long tradition of moving the fluff further and
   further down in the document.

3.  Security Considerations

   The obvious argument is that placement of notices is a security
   feature.  However, given the wide acceptance of the fact that
   security by obscurity is not an adequate defense, the use of
   obscurity to improve usability equally cannot be expected to degrade
   security.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
