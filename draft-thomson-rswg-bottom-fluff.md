# Internet-Draft Markdown Template
#
# Rename this file from draft-todo-yourname-protocol.md to get started.
# Draft name format is "draft-<yourname>-<workgroup>-<name>.md".
#
# For initial setup, you only need to edit the first block of fields.
# Only "title" needs to be changed; delete "abbrev" if your title is short.
# Any other content can be edited, but be careful not to introduce errors.
# Some fields will be set automatically during setup if they are unchanged.
#
# Don't include "-00" or "-latest" in the filename.
# Labels in the form draft-<yourname>-<workgroup>-<name>-latest are used by
# the tools to refer to the current version; see "docname" for example.
#
# This template uses kramdown-rfc: https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc
# You can replace the entire file if you prefer a different format.
# Change the file extension to match the format (.xml for XML, etc...)

--- abstract

This document establishes a new policy for RFCs that moves all the fluff
(copyright notices and that sort of thing)
to the bottom of documents.

--- middle

# New Policy

No one reads the legal shrink wrap.
All we do by forcing it under their noses is annoy them
and waste their time.

The IETF can better serve its audience
by moving boilerplate to the bottom of documents.
This ensures that notices exist,
but are minimally annoying.


# Security Considerations

The obvious argument is that placement of notices is a security feature.
However, given the wide acceptance of the fact that security by obscurity is not an adequate defense,
the use of obscurity to improve usability equally cannot be expected to degrade security.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Acknowledgments

for continuing their ongoing defense of the intellectual property in RFCs.
