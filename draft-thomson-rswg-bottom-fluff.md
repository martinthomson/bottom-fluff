--- abstract

This document establishes a new policy for RFCs that moves all the fluff
(copyright notices and that sort of thing)
to the bottom of documents.

--- middle

# New Policy

No one reads the legal shrink wrap.
All we do by forcing it under their noses is annoy them
and waste their time.

The IETF can better serve its audience
by moving boilerplate to the bottom of documents.
This ensures that notices exist,
but are minimally annoying.


# Security Considerations

The obvious argument is that placement of notices is a security feature.
However, given the wide acceptance of the fact that security by obscurity is not an adequate defense,
the use of obscurity to improve usability equally cannot be expected to degrade security.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Acknowledgments
{:numbered="false"}

The Internet Protocol Mercenary Company (IPMC) are acknowledged
for continuing their ongoing defense of the intellectual property in RFCs.
